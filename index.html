         <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
         <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 16, 2025</p>
         <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how the n8n LinkedIn Automation application ("the Application") handles data in compliance with applicable regulations. The Application is a personal automation tool designed to aggregate publicly available Hong Kong news, generate social media content using a local AI model, and post to LinkedIn to raise awareness on relevant topics.</p>

         <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
         <p>The Application collects publicly available news headlines from sources such as the South China Morning Post or Hong Kong Free Press. No personal data is collected from these sources. The Application does not store or process user data beyond temporary processing for content generation.</p>

         <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
         <p>Collected news headlines are processed locally using an open-source AI model (e.g., phi3 via Ollama) to generate LinkedIn posts. These posts are shared via LinkedIn’s API, authenticated with OAuth2, using permissions granted by the user’s LinkedIn account. Data is not shared with third parties.</p>

         <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
         <p>All processing occurs on a local server. No data is stored persistently or transmitted to external servers beyond LinkedIn’s API for posting. Reasonable measures are taken to secure the local environment, including access controls and encryption where applicable.</p>

         <h2>4. User Rights</h2>
         <p>As no personal data is collected or stored, there are no user data records to access, modify, or delete. For concerns about LinkedIn posts, users may contact the application owner to manage content.</p>

         <h2>5. Contact Information</h2>
         <p>For questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, contact: <a href="mailto:your.email@example.com">your.email@example.com</a>.</p>

         <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
         <p>This policy may be updated to reflect changes in the Application’s functionality. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised "Last Updated" date.</p>
